# EcoPackAI: End-to-End Packaging Recommendation System

EcoPackAI is an end-to-end AI packaging recommendation system that:
- runs EDA + feature engineering from CSV data,
- trains ML models to predict **cost per unit** and **CO₂ per unit**,
- serves recommendations via a **FastAPI backend**,
- provides a **static HTML/JS frontend** (login/signup, recommend, dashboard, chat),
- generates **PDF/Excel** reports for saved recommendation runs,
- includes a lightweight **chat assistant** backed by the same recommender.

## 1) Repository Layout

- `DB/`
  - `ecopackai_materials.csv` (raw materials master data)
  - `ecopackai_products.csv` (raw products master data)
  - `ecopackai_recommendations.csv` (historical product↔material pairs)
  - Generated by scripts:
    - `materials_features.csv`
    - `products_features.csv`
    - `product_material_features.csv`  ✅ training dataset used by `train_models.py`
    - `plots/` (EDA plots)

- `feature_engineering.py`
  - Reads the raw CSVs in `DB/`
  - Generates engineered datasets and EDA plots

- `train_models.py`
  - Trains two regressors:
    - cost target: `estimated_cost_per_unit_usd`
    - CO₂ target: `estimated_co2_per_unit_kg`
  - Writes trained model pipelines to `models/`
  - Writes `models/model_manifest.json` used by backend inference

- `backend/`
  - `main.py` (FastAPI app)
  - `prediction.py` (loads models, builds inference features, ranks materials)
  - `chatbot.py` (simple assistant, calls `prediction.recommend`)
  - `forecasting.py` (event logging + simple linear forecast + Monte Carlo bands)
  - `database.py`, `models.py`, `auth.py` (DB + auth + user/runs/chat persistence)

- `frontend/`
  - Static HTML/CSS/JS UI
  - Uses API base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
