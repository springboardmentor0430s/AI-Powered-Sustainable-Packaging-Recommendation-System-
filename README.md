<h1>EcoPackAI</h1>
EcoPackAI is an AI-powered full-stack web platform designed to solve this challenge by recommending optimal packaging materials based on product attributes, sustainability parameters, and industry standards. The system uses machine learning models to assess material suitability and predict both environmental impact (carbon footprint) and cost efficiency. The platform integrates a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard to provide actionable sustainability insights and report measurable reductions in environmental impact, helping organizations make data-driven decisions towards greener supply chains.

<h2>Overview</h2>
The packaging industry is one of the largest contributors to global plastic waste. EcoPackAI leverages generative AI and predictive analytics to help brands—from small startups to global beverage giants—design packaging that is both sustainable and cost-effective.
<h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
<li>Material Reduction: Redesigned beverage containers to use 18% less plastic.</li>
<li>Carbon Footprint: Reduced overall CO₂ emissions by 25% through design optimization.</li>
<li>Sustainability Analytics: Real-time assessment of environmental impact during the design phase.</li>

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>AI-Driven Material Optimization: Uses machine learning to suggest the best sustainable materials (bioplastics, mushroom packaging, recycled paper) based on product requirements.</li>
<li>Lifecycle Impact Analysis (LCA): Automatically calculates the carbon footprint and environmental impact of different packaging options.</li>
<li>Cost Modeling: Predicts direct and indirect costs, including raw materials, storage, and logistics, helping businesses balance "Green" with "Profitable."</li>
<li>Regulatory Compliance: A built-in engine that checks designs against global sustainability regulations (e.g., EU Green Deal, EPR).</li>
<li>Supply Chain Integration: Optimizes packaging dimensions for logistics to reduce wasted space and transportation emissions.</li>
